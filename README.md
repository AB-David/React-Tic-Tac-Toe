# React-Tic-Tac-Toe
Created a Tic-Tac-Toe game in React managing state relationship between parent and child components

## Roadmap
It would be nice to implement a two level difficulty vs AI: Easy or Hard. 
Easy being that the player can win the game and Hard being that the best result which can be achieved by the player is a draw.
For the 'Easy' level difficulty I would set a random choice on the board on the comp's turn (That would greatly increase the chances for the player to beat the comp). 
For the 'Hard' level difficulty, I would cover all the winning combinations and make sure that the player will get blocked each time with a series of conditional statements.
